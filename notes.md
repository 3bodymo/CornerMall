# Create Layout Component

We need to make a layout for our project to apply it on all website pages. So, we create **Components** folder and add `Layout.js` file to it.

Inside `Layout.js` we make `Layout function` and export it as default.

Inside `Layout function`, we add `<Head>` (it contains an info like a title of page). We add `<header>` to control the html elements that will appear in the top of pages, also we add `<main>` to control the html elements that will appear in the body of pages, also we add `<footer>` to control the html elements that will appear in the bottom of pages.
